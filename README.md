# This is source code of Telegram bot @LinkNetworkBot
I've built this bot in order to help people find new connections in Linkedin  
Originally it was meant to help IT people from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia find a new job abroad and relocate with their families far away from the hell that Putin created.  
I've been receiving alot of positive feedback from people: they told me that their Linkedin profiles received more views of potential employees after they've added profile links in the bot.  
Helping people is something that is crucial for me in my work, that's why i really glad that i did something good in these difficult times.

Peace!
